Robotics for developers - tutorial code
=======================================

This is the source code for my [tutorial on Robotics for developers](https://nicolovaligi.com/pages/robotics-for-developers-tutorial.html). It implements a SLAM (Simultaneous Localization And Mapping) system using fiducial markers and IMU data. The code is mostly C++ with ROS and OpenCV, plus some Python (using *pandas* and *plotly*) for analyzing and plotting the results.

Packages
--------

Each step of the tutorial roughly corresponds to one *catkin* package. You'll also need the `gtsam_catkin` package for non-linear optimization.

More information
----------------

Refer to the blog linked above for more information on the project.
